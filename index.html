  <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri">The purpose of this website is to give users an insight on the harmful effects of pollution and provide real-time data of air quality index and electricity usage across North America. Users will also be able to compare their electriicty usage to the average in their area.</h5>

    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri">- Pollution is the addition of any substance (in any state of matter) or any form of energy (head, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form.  <br> - Pollution can be caused by natural events such as volcano eruptions; however nowadays in society the work “pollution” mostly refers to an anthropogenic source (created by human activity)</h5>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" >The Harmful Effects of Pollution</h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - Boosts average global temperature
    - Acidic rain which can lead to the deaths of many animals and poorly affects the surfaces of the environment.  <br>
    - Depletion of ozone; Hydrocarbons are destroying ozone molecules which will lead the the depletion of ozone layers.  <br>
    - Ozone is gas in the atmosphere that protects living organisms on earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.  <br>
    - Too much exposure to ultraviolet rays can cause a basic sunburn but can be very deadly. Too much can cause damage to tissue. <br> - Exposure to UV rays can also cause premature aging of the skin, causing wrinkly skin, liver spots, etc.  <br>
    - Exposure to UV rays can also weaken the immune system making it harder for your body to fight off infections.</h5>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" > What You Can Do to Help </h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - Using electrical transportation over regular cars that burn gasoline <br> - Turn off appliances and lights when not in use <br> - Use energy efficient light bulbs, such as LED <br> - Limit the amount of driving you by carpooling, using public transportation, biking/walking shorter distances <br>- Avoid idling of cars and electronic devices <br> - Full loads of washing machines / dryers</h5>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" > Air Quality (Air Pollution)</h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - It is caused by particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air (aerosols). <br> - The particles originate from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. <br> - Aerosols can impact the climate. <br> - Some aerosols reflect sunlight away from earth’s surface while others absorb it.</h5>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" > How Does Air Pollution Affect Our Health? </h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - Exposure to poor air quality in any given area promotes the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases <br> - The government of Canada estimated that about 15,000 premature deaths every year are linked to air pollution<br> - Effects breathing and lung conditions: asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br> - Effects heart conditions: heart attacks, heart failure, hypertension
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" > Who is Most at Risk? </h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - Older adults / younger children<br> - People who have had or have existing heart conditions<br> - People have had had or have existing breathing or lung problems<br> - People who have diabetes </h5>
    <h2 style="text-align: center" "font-family:cambria" > How is Air Pollution Monitored? </h2>
    <h5 / style = "font-family:calibri"> - In the United States the Clean Air Act requires every state to establish a network of air monitoring stations for criteria pollutants, using OAQPS (Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards). <br> - Instruments on the ground and orbiting satellites collect information. Satellites are able to detect particle pollution including smoke particles, airborne dust and industrial pollution. <br> - World-wide air Quality Monitoring Data Coverage: As of August 2020, real-time Air Quality data is available in 132 countries (2000 major cities). </h5>
    &nbsp;
    <h4 style="text-align: center"> The AQI (Air Quality Index) scale runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.</h4> <br>
